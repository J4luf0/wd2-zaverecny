      <p>Metal has something for nearly everyone, here is my starter recommendations for nonmetalheads</p>
    </div>
    <div class="overgenres">
      <div class="othergenres">
        <div class="rap">
          <h2>Rap</h2>
          <p>- for rap fans there are bands like slipknot that are known for mixing rap and metal together</p>
          <p>- here´s an example of very known band called slipknot with song "spit it out"</p>
          <div class="rapplay">
            <audio controls class="playable">
              <source src="../audio/slipknot.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
            </audio>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="pop">
          <h2>Pop</h2>
          <p>- there´s so much stuff for pop fans, even though some metalheads don´t like it</p>
          <p>- a band called Tesseract is an example of this, image on right is cover of their newest album</p>
          <p>- left example is a band called tesseract and their "poplike" song "hexes", on the right is a band jinjer with song "pisces"</p>
          <div class="popplay">
            <audio controls class="playable">
              <source src="../audio/tesseracthexes.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
            </audio>
            <audio controls class="playable">
              <source src="../audio/jinjer.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
            </audio>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="classical">
          <h2>Classical</h2>
          <p>- Tesseract is also band that has big influences from classical music, too</p>
          <p>- but there are bands like System Of A Down that combines metal with Armenian traditional music or Tool that have some very complex and long songs</p>
          <p>- first one is tool´s song "Schizm" and the next is a System Of A down song called "Holy Mountains"</p>
          <div class="classicalplay">
            <audio controls class="playable">
              <source src="../audio/tool.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
            </audio>
            <audio controls class="playable">

          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="funkjazz">
          <h2>Funk/Jazz</h2>
          <p>- it´s not as evident as in other genres, if you listen to bass in band called Mudvayne, you can clearly hear a really funky basslines, their album cover on the right leads you to their song "death blooms"</p>
          <p>- also there is a band called Animals As Leaders that has a big influence in jazz, here´s an example of them with song called "woven web"</p>
